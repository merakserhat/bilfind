## Description
**BilFind** is motivated by creating a campus-exclusive social marketplace for the Bilkent University community. We understand that within the vibrant ecosystem of a university, there is a constant exchange of resources, information, and goodwill. However, this often occurs through non-centralized, for-profit, and unsafe platforms. **BilFind** aims to leverage the power of technology to enhance this exchange, making it easier for students, faculty, and staff to connect and collaborate.

**BilFind includes the following features:**
- **User Profiles**: Customizable profiles to represent their roles (student, faculty, staff, or department) and interests
- **Marketplace**: A marketplace for buying and selling second-hand items, including textbooks, electronic devices, furniture, and department requirements
- **Lost and Found**: A feature to report lost items and return the found items to their owners
- **Borrowing**: A platform where the university community can borrow and lend items to one another
- **Donation**: A feature to give and receive donations, free books, or tools
- **Real-Time Chat**: A feature that allows users to easily communicate with each other instantly via the application

**BilFind** creates a safe environment as personal data is not shared with anonymous people and was developed for only the Bilkent University community. It also enables resource sharing efficiently and quickly. Making it easier to use second-hand goods and offering the option of borrowing products instead of purchasing them prevents unnecessary use of resources.

Overall, **BilFind** sets itself apart with its simple, user-friendly design that's easy on the eyes and intuitive to use. Navigating through **BilFind** is a breeze, making it a go-to platform for each member of the university.
Moreover, **Bilfind** ensures that your data is safe & sound and gives you the confidence to use it without worrying about the privacy of your data.

**BilFind protects your data with the following techniques:**
- **Data Encryption**: Your sensitive data is stored in an encrypted way.
- **Bilkent-Based Community**: Only Bilkent e-mails are accepted for registration.
- **Personal Privacy**: None of your data is shared with others unless you want to.
But **BilFind** isn't just about features; it's about making your university experience friendlier. By connecting each campus member in a dedicated space, **Bilfind** creates a sense of community and collaboration beyond mere functionality.
